## Building The Project with Visual Studio
Clone the project into a new directory and open the .sln file in Visual Studio. The program uses a few precompiled binarys. So if you're having trouble building it's likely due to GLFW or GLEW. If you have any questions, feel free to message me on discord (tap#0061)
## Operating Systems
At the moment this project only supports Windows but you could pretty easily switch it over by setting up a new keyboard handler and changing the PlaySound() function to be something else. You will also need to build your own binarys for GLFW and GLEW.
